## Background
By the end of 2022, BeReal combined all the photos taken in a year and made a timelapse. However, for some reason the timelapse was stopped in 2023.
Searching across the internet, I came across this project made by [theOneAndOnlyOne](https://github.com/theOneAndOnlyOne). It did not give the output I wanted, so I decided to decided to folk the project and make my own version of it.

## Generating the 1st two seconds
The first two second is all the photos taken put into 2 second. This is done by using the `opencv` and `moviepy` library. Also, a text is overladed on top of the image.

### Appending images together
```py filename="recap.py" copy
part1 = ImageSequenceClip(images, durations=[2 / len(images)] * len(images))
part1.write_videofile("part1.mp4", fps=frames_per_second)
```
$(2 / len(images)) * len(images)$ is the duration of each image. This is done to make sure that the video is 2 seconds long. 

### Adding text to the video
```py filename="recap.py" copy
cap = cv2.VideoCapture("part1.mp4")
fps = int(cap.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FPS))
width = int(cap.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_WIDTH))
height = int(cap.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_HEIGHT))

out = cv2.VideoWriter(
    "output.mp4", cv2.VideoWriter_fourcc(*"mp4v"), fps, (width, height)
)
while cap.isOpened():
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    if ret == True:
        frame = add_text_to_frame(
            frame,
            "RECAP 2023",
            200,
            width,
            height,
            text_color=(255, 255, 255),
        )
        out.write(frame)
        if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord("q"):
            break
    else:
        break
```
`add_text_to_frame` is a function that adds text to the frame. The text is "RECAP 2023" and the color is white.

### Generating the blank screen
The blank screen is like a transition and it has "RECAP 2023" in the middle. This is done by using the `opencv` library.

```py filename="recap.py" copy
blank = np.zeros((height, width, 3), np.uint8)
blank = add_text_to_frame(
    blank,
    "RECAP 2023",
    200,
    width,
    height,
    text_color=(255, 255, 255),
)
```
Each pixel in the image is set to 0. Then the text is added to the image.

## Generating the rest of the video
The rest of the video is the timelapse of all the photos and the time between each photo follows a bezier curve. This is done by using the `moviepy` library.

### Generating the bezier curve
```py filename="recap.py" copy
def bezier_curve(t, p0, p1, p2, p3):
    return (
        (1 - t) ** 3 * p0
        + 3 * (1 - t) ** 2 * t * p1
        + 3 * (1 - t) * t**2 * p2
        + t**3 * p3
    )
```

### Generating the timelapse
```py filename="recap.py" copy
part2 = ImageSequenceClip(images, durations=durations)
```
`durations` is the time between each photo. This is calculated using the bezier curve.

## Combining the videos
The two videos are combined using the `moviepy` library.

```py filename="recap.py" copy
    final_clip = concatenate_videoclips(clips, method="chain")
    final_clip.write_videofile(
        output_path, fps=frames_per_second, threads=6, codec="libx264"
    )
```
Finally, the temp video is deleted.

```python filename="recap.py" copy
os.remove("part1.mp4")
```
