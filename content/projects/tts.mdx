## Motivation
For my multimedia project, I was tasked with developing a text-to-speech application. However, there was a restriction: I couldnâ€™t use any external APIs, such as Google Text-to-Speech.

To overcome this limitation, I opted to use the native browser APIs. These APIs not only offer speed but also come free of charge. Specifically, I utilized the Web Speech API to convert text into speech. 
## Features

- Convert text into speech
- Dark mode support
- Simple and easy to use
- Works by using native browser APIs
- Support pitch and rate adjustment
