## Motivation 
Adding your timetable into Google Calendar can be a tedious task. This script aims to automate the process of adding your timetable into Google Calendar by using 
the Google Calendar API. I decided to use pyhton for this project as it is a language that I am familiar with and it has a library for the Google Calendar API.

## Prerequisites

To run this quickstart, you need the following prerequisites:

- <a href="https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-project" target="_blank" className="external">A Google Cloud project</a>
- A Google account with Google Calendar enabled.

## Create a Google Cloud Project

1. In the Google Cloud console, go to **Menu menu** > **IAM & Admin** > **Create a Project**.
   <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate" className="button button-primary" target="console">Go to Create a Project</a>
2. In the **Project Name** field, enter a any name for your project.
3. Click **Create**. The Google Cloud console navigates to the Dashboard page and your project is created within a few minutes.

## Setting up the enviroment

To complete this quickstart, set up your environment.

### Enable the API

Before using Google APIs, you need to turn them on in a Google Cloud project. You can turn on one or more APIs in a single Google Cloud project.

- In the Google Cloud console, enable the Google Calendar API.
  <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=calendar-json.googleapis.com" className="button button-primary" target="console">Enable the API</a>

### Configure the OAuth consent screen

1. In the Google Cloud console, go to **Menu menu** > **APIs & Services** > **OAuth consent screen**.
   <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent" className="button button-primary" target="console">Go to OAuth consent screen</a>
2. Select the **External** for user type for your app, then click **Create**.
3. Complete the app registration form (only items marked with \*) , then click **Save and Continue**.
4. Click **Save and Continue** again.
5. Under **Test users**, click **Add users**.
6. Enter your email address, then click **Save and Continue**.
7. Review your app registration summary. To make changes, click **Edit**. If the app registration looks OK, click **Back to Dashboard**.

### Authorize credentials for a desktop application

1. In the Google Cloud console, go to Menu menu > APIs & Services > Credentials.
   <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials" className="button button-primary" target="console">Go to Credentials</a>

2. Click **Create Credentials** > **OAuth client ID**.
3. Click **Application type** > **Desktop app**.
4. In the **Name** field, type a name for the credential. This name is only shown in the Google Cloud console.
5. Click **Create**. The OAuth client created screen appears, showing your new Client ID and Client secret.
6. Click **OK**. The newly created credential appears under OAuth 2.0 Client IDs.
7. Save the downloaded JSON file as **credentials.json**, and move the file to your working directory.

## Initial setup
They are the default values for the program. They can be changed by the user.

### Authorization
To access Google Calendar, the scopes must be set and **credentials.json** must be present in the working directory.

```py copy filename="main.py"
SCOPES = [
    "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar",
    "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.calendarlist",
]
```

### Setting the defaults
Selecting which calendar to use and the number of weeks to add to the calendar.

```py copy filename="main.py"
CALENDAR_TO_USE = "Timetable"
NUM_WEEKS = 22
```

### Generating the token
The first time the program is run, the user will be prompted to authenticate and give permission to the program to access the calendar.

```py copy filename="main.py"
def auth():
    """Creates a Google Calendar API service object and outputs token.json"""
    creds = None
    # The file token.json stores the user's access and refresh tokens, and is
    # created automatically when the authorization flow completes for the first
    # time.
    if os.path.exists("token.json"):
        creds = Credentials.from_authorized_user_file("token.json", SCOPES)
    # If there are no (valid) credentials available, let the user log in.

    if not creds or not creds.valid:
        if creds and creds.expired and creds.refresh_token:
            creds.refresh(Request())
        else:
            flow = InstalledAppFlow.from_client_secrets_file("credentials.json", SCOPES)
            creds = flow.run_local_server(port=0)
        # Save the credentials for the next run
        with open("token.json", "w") as token:
            token.write(creds.to_json())
    return creds
```
