Play the game [here](https://www.higherlowergame.com/)

## Game Mechanics
The Higher Lower game is a guessing game that tests your knowledge of search popularity. Here's how it works:
- You are given two options and the average monthly search is displayed for one of the options
- The goal is to guess which option has been searched for more
- You choose **"Higher"** or **"Lower"** based on your guess.
- After your guess, the game reveals the correct answer and presents a new pair of options.
- You keep playing until you guess incorrectly. The aim is to get the most consecutive guesses right.

## How the bot works
The bot uses the `selenium` library to automate the game. It used json files as a database to store the search popularity of the options. The bot then compares the search popularity of the options and selects **"Higher"** or **"Lower"** based on the comparison.

### Opening a web browser
The bot opens a web browser and navigates to the Higher Lower game website.

```python filename="main.py" copy  {10,4-6}
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.options import Options

chrome_options = Options()
path = r"adblock.crx"
chrome_options.add_extension(path)

driver = webdriver.Chrome(options=chrome_options)
driver.get("https://www.higherlowergame.com/")
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="root"]/div/span/section/div[2]/div/button[1]').click()
```
It loads the adblock extension and the clicks the "Play" button to start the game.

### Data Collection
The bot collects the search popularity of the options and stores it in a json file. If the data already exists, it just ignores it.

```python filename="main.py" copy  
def add_to_json(new_data, filename="data.json"):
 try:
   with open(filename, "r") as file:
     data = json.load(file)
 except FileNotFoundError:
   data = []

 exists = any(item["name"] == new_data["name"] for item in data)

 if not exists:
   data.append(new_data)

   with open(filename, "w") as file:
     json.dump(data, file, indent=4) 
 else:
   # Indicate that the name already exists
   print(f"Name '{new_data['name']}' already exists in {filename}. Data not added.")
```

### Game Automation
The bot automates the game by comparing the search popularity of the options and selecting **"Higher"** or **"Lower"** based on the comparison. If the search popularity is not found, it randomly guesses between **"Higher"** and **"Lower"**.

```python filename="main.py" copy
if get_value(searchTerm) == None:
    print(f"search term not found {searchTerm}")
    # randomly guess between high and low
    guess = random.choice(['//*[@id="root"]/div/span/span/div/div[2]/div[2]/button[1]', '//*[@id="root"]/div/span/span/div/div[2]/div[2]/button[2]'])
    driver.find_element(By.XPATH, guess).click()
    time.sleep(2)
    try:
        playAgain = driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="game-over-btn"]').click()
    except:
        pass
else:
    if int(leftAmount) < int(get_value(searchTerm)):
        print(f"guessing high")
        driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="root"]/div/span/span/div/div[2]/div[2]/button[1]').click()
    else:
        print(f"guessing low")
        driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="root"]/div/span/span/div/div[2]/div[2]/button[2]').click()
    time.sleep(2)
```
## Conclusion
After running the program for 2 hours straight, the json file contained around 1500 search terms. The bot was able to reach a highscore of 1000 and was able to play without any human intervention.
